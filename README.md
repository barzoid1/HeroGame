I'm building an app takes user input and fetches a superhero with the name equal to the input
and compares the user powerstats with a randomly generated superhero's powerstat and the choice with greater power stat wins.
but the problem is that the comparism function isnt working.
I'd be happy if you take a look and leave suggestions and solutions. 
There is no  design yet!
